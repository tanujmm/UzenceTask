# React Component Development Assignment

This project was built as part of the **Front-End Assignment** to create reusable UI components using **React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Storybook**.

## 🚀 Components

### 1. InputField
A flexible input component with:
- Variants: `filled`, `outlined`, `ghost`
- Sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
- States: disabled, invalid, error, helper text
- Features: clear button, password toggle

### 2. DataTable
A data table with:
- Column-based sorting
- Row selection (single/multiple)
- Loading state
- Empty state

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Storybook for documentation and component testing

## 📘 Approach
The approach was to build **scalable, reusable components**:
- Defined clear prop interfaces in TypeScript
- Used Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Added multiple states and variants for flexibility
- Documented all component states in Storybook

## 📦 Setup Instructions
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
